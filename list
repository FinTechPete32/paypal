-- There are 4 important steps we need to carry out 
in order to push from our local machine (
AWS > EC2 instance like (Amazon Linux, Ubuntu, Redhat, etc)) 
into our remote repository


Step 1: Create a Working Area

--	We all need to setup/make a local directory also known
	as a (Working Area) then create or add a file 
   	using touch command with filename 
   	please dont forget to add some context to the file. 
   
   	We also need have git install so we can inital a 
   	git repository that help in creating a default 
   	branch [master, main] 
   	
	by using this command: git init 


Step 2: Add to Staging Area

--	Once our local project directory has been setup 
	and the git initiation is completed 
	then we can carry out the next steps:

	We need to add our file in the local directory 
	into the git repository on our local machine
	which is also known as (Staging Area)

	by using this command: 	git add fileName  
  				git add .   
  				git add *
        

Step 3:	Commit to Local Repository

--	Once our Staging setup is completed. 
	We can also check status and log by 
	using the following commands:
	
	git status - 	To track our file location activity
	git log - 	To keeps all committed activity

	We can carry out the next steps:

	Before committing our file we need to config our 
	global setting by adding user email and user name
 
	Then we need to commit our file in the staging area into
	our local git repository which is known 
	as (Local Repository)

	by using this command: git commit -m filename


Step 4: Push to Remote Repository

--	Once our local repository has been fully committed
	We need to add our remote repository location address
	before starting a push process
	
	by using this command: git remote add aliasName repoURL
	
	Then we're ready to move our file from the git 
	repository on our local machine to our remote 
	SCM environment (Source Code Manager > GitHub)
	
	by using this command: git push aliasName branchName

	To complete this step, you will need to provide 
	an active GitHub credentials 
	username and an active generated token 
	since GitHub users can no longer authenicate 
	using password
